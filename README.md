# Cifar10 Dataset
CIFAR10 is a dataset consisting of over 60,000 images 32 x 32 color images in 10 classes (airplane,automobile,bird,cat,deer,dog,etc...) with 1000 images in training folder in each class and testing folder contains 5000 images in each class. In this tutorial,I have used the cifar10 dataset to train a convolutional neural network model to predict the type of an image and its confidence percentage.
